# Making-Brainwaves

This project is inspired by Project Brainwave by Microsoft!

It contains:
- a matrix vector multiplication engine, capable of computing up to 24 outputs in a single computation at 200 MHz
- a fully pipelined activation unit using a fully-pipelined taylor series approximation of the hyperbolic tangent function ($tanh$)
